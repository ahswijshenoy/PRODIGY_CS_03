## Password Strength Checker
This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to assess the strength of user passwords based on multiple security criteria. It uses regular expressions to check for various password characteristics, giving users real-time feedback on their password's strength.

# Features
1. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assesses passwords based on their length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback as users type in their passwords, indicating which security criteria have been met.

3. **Visual Strength Indicator:** Displays the password strength as "Strong", "Moderate", or "Weak" based on the criteria met, with color coding (green, orange, red) for visual ease.

# Technical Details
- **Language:** Python
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter for creating the application interface.
- **Regex Library:** Utilizes Pythonâ€™s re module to efficiently evaluate the password against multiple criteria.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Dynamic feedback provided through updates to the GUI, informing users of the necessary requirements for a strong password.

# How It Works
The application checks the entered password against several criteria:
- Length of at least 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one numeral
- At least one special character
Feedback is compiled and displayed as a list of met or unmet criteria, and the overall strength of the password is summarized at the bottom of the window.

# Setup and Usage
**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need Tkinter, which is included with Python from version 3.1 onwards.
